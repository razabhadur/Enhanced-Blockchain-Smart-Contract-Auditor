# Enhanced Blockchain Smart Contract Auditor

The Enhanced Blockchain Smart Contract Auditor is a robust tool designed to simulate the intricate process of auditing smart contracts on the blockchain. With a focus on security and efficiency, this tool offers users the ability to identify common coding patterns that might lead to vulnerabilities, analyze gas usage and limits, and ensure that sensitive functions and state variables are not publicly accessible.

## Features

- **Enhanced Code Pattern Analysis**: Identifies common coding patterns that might lead to vulnerabilities.
- **Gas Limit Analysis**: Checks gas limits in smart contracts to identify potential issues.
- **Function Visibility Analysis**: Checks function visibilities to ensure sensitive functions are not publicly accessible.
- **State Variable Visibility Analysis**: Checks state variable visibilities to ensure sensitive variables are not publicly accessible.
- **Enhanced Reporting**: Provides a detailed summary of the identified issues.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python enhanced_smart_contract_auditor.py
   ```
3. Review the generated report for insights and potential risks.
